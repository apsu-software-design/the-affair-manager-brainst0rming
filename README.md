# The Affair Manager

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage events (called "affairs" in the code), created as part of an assignment for CSCI 4602 at Austin Peay State University.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? #####
> I drew an UML class diagram of all relevant objects. I then determined object fields and methods.


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Endless amounts of MDN and TypeScript documentation.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 15 hours


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> 9


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I had to change the JS target to ES2016 due to using JavaScript private fields and Array.prototype.includes().
